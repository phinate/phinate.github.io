**I build software for research, develop and apply machine learning methods, and care about outreach and community building.**

Right now, I work at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://turing.ac.uk/) in the [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering-group). [Here's what I'm focusing on right now](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-numerical-weather-prediction-nwp-ai4nwp).

Want to know more? Check out my [projects page](projects.qmd), or [browse the animation gallery](animations.qmd), where I've collected some of my favourite visualisations from my time in research. 

Thanks for stopping by! âœ¨
